To start working with Angular 2, you need to get the following key components installed.

*   **Npm** − This is known as the node package manager that is used to work with the open source repositories. Angular JS as a framework has dependencies on other components. And **npm** can be used to download these dependencies and attach them to your project.
    
*   **Git** − This is the source code software that can be used to get the sample application from the **github** angular site.
    
*   **Editor** − There are many editors that can be used for Angular JS development such as Visual Studio code and WebStorm. In our tutorial, we will use Visual Studio code which comes free of cost from Microsoft.
