excerpt: Happiness is not the result, but it is a driver. Sometimes I wonder how can we be happy in today's fast-paced world.

**Steve Jobs** had famously said _Your work is going to fill a large part of your life_ and I think in that statement somewhere lies the secret to being happy. I can directly derive the relationship that to be happy in life you to be happy at work. So now the question is **_How can you be happy at work?_**
The answer can be summarised in only two points

# Strive For Excellence
You need to strive for excellence in your work. One's true success in life begins only when they make a COMMITMENT to be excellent at what they do. Without this commitment, they will always perform at mediocre or average levels and it will be difficult to reach their full potential. Excellence spins off positive results in all endeavours that we human beings encounter.
Every study of high achieving individuals proves that greatness in life is only possible when you become EXCELLENT in your chosen field. If you are a plumber or an electrician, strive to be better than the BEST out there.
Life's best rewards result from performing in an EXCELLENT fashion. Don't ever shortchange yourself by accepting mediocrity!

# Ensure your work makes someone happy
You will be satisfied with your work only when the outcome of your work is useful for someone. I work in an industry where [68% of software projects fail](http://www.zdnet.com/article/study-68-percent-of-it-projects-fail/) or are just scrapped for various reasons. It is never a great feeling when you are involved in one of such product. Put everything you can to ensure your project is successful and more importantly it is useful for someone out there.
