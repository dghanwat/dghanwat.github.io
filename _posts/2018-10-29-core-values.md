What does the word value mean to you? Can you define it?
Values are what you believe matter most in life. Everyone’s values are different. Some common values are love, success, friendship, intelligence, and respect

Values have a great impact on our inner world. They help ensure you behave in a way that matches who you want to be at your core.

That’s why I am writing my own personal core values to get things straight for myself. I recommend you to do the same

Here are my Values

### Honesty
Be Honest at every occasion, especially when it comes to your own life. Honesty is not just about telling the truth. It’s about being real with yourself and others about who you are, what you want and what you need to live your life.

### Integrity
Do your best even when other people aren't around. It is about being same regardless of the situation. You don’t have a ‘work you,’ a ‘family you,’ and a ‘social you.’ You are YOU all the time.

### Don't Be Afraid of Breaking Things
Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times before he created the light bulb. Don’t fear the future. Do the right thing with utmost honesty and you can face any consequence resulting from your actions. You can fix failure. You can’t fix the things you never tried.

### Loyalty
Even though you might not see your old friends, co-workers, team members, stay loyal. Once you build a bond with someone, don’t break it unless it’s necessary. But most importantly, stay loyal to yourself. Never sacrifice your own mental well-being for others. Treat yourself like you treat someone you love
