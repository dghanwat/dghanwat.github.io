General concepts
----

KISS
----
* Anyone should be able to use your API without having to refer to the documentaTon.
* Use standard, concrete and shared terms, not your specific business terms or acronyms.
* Never allow application developers to do things more than one way.
* Design your API for your clients (Application developers), not for your data.
* Target major uses cases first, deal with exceptions later.

CURL
----
You should use CURL to share examples, which can be easily copy/paste.

Medium grained resources
----
You should use medium grained, not fine nor coarse. Resources shouldn’t be nested more than two level deep

Design Rules
----

### URI Format


* Forward slash separator (/) must be used to indicate a hierarchical relationship
* A trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs
* Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs
* Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs
* Lowercase letters should be preferred in URI paths
* File extensions should not be included in URIs

### URI Path Design

* A singular noun should be used for document names
* A plural noun should be used for collection names
* A plural noun should be used for store names
* A verb or verb phrase should be used for controller names
* Variable path segments may be substituted with identity-based values
* CRUD function names should not be used in URIs

### URI Query Design

* The query component of a URI may be used to filter collections or stores
* The query component of a URI should be used to paginate collection or store results

### Request Methods

* GET and POST must not be used to tunnel other request methods
* GET must be used to retrieve a representation of a resource
* HEAD should be used to retrieve response headers
* PUT must be used to both insert and update a stored resource
* PUT must be used to update mutable resources
* POST must be used to create a new resource in a collection
* POST must be used to execute controllers
* DELETE must be used to remove a resource from its parent
* OPTIONS should be used to retrieve metadata that describes a resource’s available interactions

### Response Status Codes

* 200 (“OK”) should be used to indicate nonspecific success
* 200 (“OK”) must not be used to communicate errors in the response body
* 201 (“Created”) must be used to indicate successful resource creation
* 202 (“Accepted”) must be used to indicate successful start of an asynchronous action
* 204 (“No Content”) should be used when the response body is intentionally empty
* 401 (“Unauthorized”) must be used when there is a problem with the client’s credentials
* 403 (“Forbidden”) should be used to forbid access regardless of authorization state
* 404 (“Not Found”) must be used when a client’s URI cannot be mapped to a resource. This also means when the request to search or get details of an entity, like say /user/100
* 409 (“Conflict”) should be used to indicate a violation of resource state
* 412 (“Precondition Failed”) should be used to support conditional operations
* 500 (“Internal Server Error”) should be used to indicate API malfunction

### HTTP Headers

* Content-Type must be used
* Content-Length should be used
* Last-Modified should be used in responses
* ETag should be used in responses
* Stores must support conditional PUT requests
* Location must be used to specify the URI of a newly created resource
* Cache-Control, Expires, and Date response headers should be used to encourage caching
* Cache-Control, Expires, and Pragma response headers may be used to discourage caching
* Caching should be encouraged
* Expiration caching headers should be used with 200 (“OK”) responses
* Expiration caching headers may optionally be used with 3xx and 4xx responses
* Custom HTTP headers must not be used to change the behavior of HTTP methods

### Error Representation

* A consistent form should be used to represent errors
* A consistent form should be used to represent error responses
* Consistent error types should be used for common error conditions

### Versioning

* New URIs should be used to introduce new concepts

### Security

* OAuth may be used to protect resources
* API management solutions may be used to protect resources

### JavaScript Clients

* JSONP should be supported to provide multi-origin read access from JavaScript
* CORS should be supported to provide multi-origin read/write access from JavaScript
